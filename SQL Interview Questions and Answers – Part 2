Second Normal Form (2NF): Follows 1NF and makes and places information subsets in an individual table and characterizes the connection between tables utilizing essential key.
Third Normal Form (3NF): Follows 2NF and evacuates those segments which don’t relate through the essential key.
Fourth Normal Form (4NF): Follows 3NF and don’t characterize multi-valued conditions. 4NF otherwise called BCNF.

Q.3 Distinguish between Nested Subquery and Correlated Subquery?

SELECT adminid(SELEC Firstname+' '+Lastname FROM Employee WHERE
empid=emp. adminid)AS EmpAdminId FROM Employee;

Syntax:

CREATE Technique Technique_Name
(
/Parameters
)
AS
Start
SQL statements in stored methods to refresh/recover records
END
Q.5 What do we have to check in Database Testing?

Ans. The following attributes for testing –

Database Connectivity
Constraint Check
Required Application Field and its size
Data Retrieval and Processing With DML operations
Stored Procedures
Functional flow
4. Practical SQL Interview Questions and Answers
After practicing some tough SQL Interview Questions, let’s move towards the Practical SQL Interview Questions and Answers –

Q.1  How to compose an inquiry to demonstrate the points of interest of an understudy from Students table whose name begins with K?
